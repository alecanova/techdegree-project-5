 Public API Requests

 This website gets random user data from the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) and shows user data in a fake company employee directory. Clicking on each user allows you to open a modal window with additional details. The directory has also a search bar with a keyup and a submit event.

 The CSS has been modified with color and shadow styling.
